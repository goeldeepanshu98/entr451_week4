# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 3-arrays.rb

# Arrays are lists of things

foods = ["tacos", "pizza", "ice cream"]
# x = 6
# p foods
# p x

# numbers = [4,8,15,16,23,42]

# Accessing the array

# puts numbers[-3]
# puts numbers[1090808].inspect

# Add to the array

# shopping_list = foods << "salt"
# puts shopping_list
# puts foods << "salt"
# foods.push "eggs"
# p foods
foods.push(foods)
# puts foods
puts foods[3][2][4]
# There are lots of fun things you can do with arrays:
